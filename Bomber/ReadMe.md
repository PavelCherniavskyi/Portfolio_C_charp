# Overview
This project was made as final work on C# via .NET course. It is not so presentable and good looking as my other works and written in clear console. But here I've implemented all skills that learned on that course. 

### Controls
- Moving around : arrows
- Change bomb direction : WASD
- Plant bomb : space
- P : player
- E : enemies
- L : take life
- B : increasing bomb explosion by 1
